**Demi-god Offspring** #1
I'm sorry your mother has befallen ill. I shall say you are the only one to have entered Babel in search of a cure. You are brave I will give you that. My father however will not be easy to defeat. For his resentment towards both his own and your people has festered for countless millennia. 
As you mortals would say, he's rather stubborn. While I can not help you defeat him, I have left you pages of your mothers journal. Perhaps this will give you the power to continue your journey. Goodluck to you.

**Old timey speak:**
I extend my sympathies for your mother's illness. It is notable that you alone have dared to venture into Babel seeking a cure. Your courage is commendable. Yet, my father's resentment has endured across countless millennia.

His resentment towards both his kin and yours has festered across countless ages. As you mortals would say, he's rather stubborn.

Though I cannot directly intervene in your battle against him, I have bestowed upon you pages from your mother's journal. May they bestow upon you the strength and wisdom needed to persevere on your quest. May good fortune favor your endeavors."


**Mom Journal Entries**
Entry 1: 
My mother used to tell me tall tales before I went to bed each night. Stories about a time ruled by the heavy hand of immortals with great power.
I would go to bed dreaming about the betrayal of the evil king and the prison of the gods: questioning whether or not any of it could be true.
Now I tell my son these same tales, wondering if he to has the same dreams.

Entry 2: 
Felt ill the past couple days. Assumed it was nothing but a usual ailment, now I'm not so sure. So I spent the night in the catacombs as to not infect my boy with the same plague. 
I shall wait a couple days before I return home for I'm sure this shall pass. 

Prison of the Gods 1:
He was a relatively minor god older than humanity itself A diety who grew to loved the humans when they sprang from caly and hearth. 
During the era of gods and monsters, he had been content with his role as a healer. His powers over ones wellbeing marveled those of any immortal. 

Entry 3: 
As the sickness pursues, I have found solace in the pages of parchment before me. Resolving to commit to writing the tales I've heard my entire life. Perhaps this will be a gift to my son once my ailment as acquitted itself.

And so, with each stroke of my quill, I honor not only those who have passed these stories down to me but also honor the eternal bond that binds us allâ€” the timeless thread of humanity. 

Prison of the Gods 2: 
Some say he admired the simple minded nature of the humans and their undying faithfullness to his kind. 
As years passed, he watched as the simple minded nature developed into complexity. He too fell in love with their unbounded resilience and creativity. 

Prison of the Gods 3:

Demigod Offspring #2: 
I shall warn you tiny mortal, my father senses a disturbance with in the tower. He knows you have fought the gods and are using their powers to your advantage. 

See it as a sign of mercy that he has chosen to send more monsters your way instead of ending you himself. 

**Old timey speak:**
I must caution you, fragile mortal, for my father senses an unsettling disturbance within the tower. He is keenly aware of your clashes with the gods and your adeptness in harnessing their powers to your advantage.
View it as a token of clemency that he opts to unleash more monsters upon your path rather than confronting you directly, sparing you from his wrath.

"Courageous heart, heed these warnings."

Demigod Offspring #3:

I am glad you have been able to put that sword to good use. My father gave it to me during the human's struggle with the gods because as you know it has the ability to cut them down. I used it to entrap some of my own. But that's when I thought my father was a noble man, I know now how wrong I was. Now the sword is yours. My you use it's god slaying abilities to take down my father. 

Just remember while your valor shines, yet danger looms. 

Old Speak:
I am pleased to see that you have wielded that sword with purpose. It was a gift from my father during the humans' conflict with the gods, bestowed for its unique ability to cleave through divine flesh. I once employed it to ensnare some of my own kin, blinded by my belief in my father's righteousness. Now, however, I see the folly of my trust. The sword now belongs to you. May you harness its power to bring about the downfall of my father.

Yet, amidst your valor, remember that peril still surrounds you.
