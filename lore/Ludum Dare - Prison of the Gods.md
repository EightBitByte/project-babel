### Characters
#### Evil God: 
- A god who wanted to become sole ruler over all. He was a relatively minor god who loved the humans. 
- **A relatively minor diety older than humanity itself. During the era of gods and monsters, he had been content with his role as a healer. His powers over ones wellbeing marveled those of any immortal being.** 
- When the day came that humans grew from clay and hearth, the minor god found himself mesmerized by their ways. 
- **He admired the simple minded nature of the humans and their undying faithfullness to his kind. 
- As years passed, he watched as the simple minded nature developed into complexity. He too fell in love with their unbounded resilience and creativity. 
- **Legends say he even fell in love with a human. Though not much is known a child is rumored to have been a product of their love. 
- As the era of humans reered it's ugly tail, the minor diety witnessed as the rise of human individualism bridged a gap between the love humans had for his kind. He went to the different ruling gods of the time (Zues, Hera, Osiris, Isis etc) and mentioned his worries for the divide. Fearful that the humans would grow to dislike his people and turn their backs onto them. For then he wouldn't beable to marvel at their attempts to live a full fleating life. 
- Nively, he expected the gods to lend a helping hand. Instead they created wars amongst the humans. Stopped the crops in which the humans fed upon. When he questioned their actions they told him to do nothing. To watch how now they would come running back praying for mercy and good will. 
- With a heavy heart he watched as war, hunger and chaos broke out amongst the humans, the beings he had grown to love so dearly themselves. 
- **Angry and resentful towards the ruling gods, the minor diety decided only he could make a difference. If he ruled over all, the humans would be rid of the chaos and pain. So he decided to use the humans desire to be rid of the gods as a way to obtain his crown. 
- With the help of the minor god, the humans built the tower of Babel. The prison of gods A symbol of their own resilience. A reminder that humans were able to touch the heavens with out the help of the gods. As time went on, humans began trapping the gods with the help of the minor god. 
- **The era of gods and monsters came to an end. Proud of what he had been able to do for the humans, the minor god sat upon the tower smiling at the humans, ready for the chaos to come to an end. 
- **But it was to late, the chaos had been sewn to deeply into the ways of humans. 
- Angry the minor god cursed the humans for what they had allowed themselves to become and angry at his kind for having had any part in it. 
- Out of this pain, every 100 years he would curse a human to die a slow death by sickness, a reminder of the slow distaste he had grown to feel towards his once most cherished friends.
