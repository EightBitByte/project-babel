#### Offering #1
${NAME} I extend my sympathies for your mother's illness. It is notable that you alone have dared to venture into Babel seeking a cure. Your courage is commendable. Yet, my father's resentment has endured across countless millennia.

His resentment towards both his kin and yours has festered across countless ages. As you mortals would say, he's rather stubborn.

Though I cannot directly intervene in your battle against him, I have bestowed upon you pages from your mother's journal. May they bestow upon you the strength and wisdom needed to persevere on your quest. 

May good fortune favor your endeavors.

#### Entry 1: 
My mother used to tell me tall tales before I went to bed each night. Stories about a time ruled by the heavy hand of immortals with great power.

I would go to bed dreaming about the betrayal of the evil king and the prison of the gods: questioning whether or not any of it could be true.

Now I tell my son these same tales, wondering if he too has the same dreams.

#### Entry 2: 
Felt ill the past couple days. Assumed it was nothing but an usual ailment, now I'm not so sure. So I spent the night in the archives as to not infect ${NAME} with the same plague. 

Though my son didn't like the idea of leaving me alone, I've decided I shall wait a couple days before I return for I'm sure this shall pass. 

#### Prison of the Gods #1:
He was a relatively minor god during the Era of the gods and monsters. One older than humanity itself. A diety who grew to love the humans so dearly when they sprang from clay and hearth. 

Despite having powers over ones wellbeing that marveled those of any immortal, he had been content with abiding by the minor role bestowed upon him.

#### Entry #3: 
As the sickness pursues, I have found solace in the pages of the parchment before me. Resolving to commit to writing the tales I've heard my entire life. Those of the gods and monsters. 

Perhaps my account of these tales, will be a gift to my son once my ailment as acquitted itself. As simple reminder of his undeniable strength and the time we spent together. 

In a way I suppose with the stroke of my quill, I honor not only those who have passed these stories down to me but also the eternal bond that binds us allâ€”the timeless thread of humanity. 

#### Prison of the Gods #2: 
Some say he admired the simple minded nature of the humans and their undying faith fullness to his kind. 
As years passed, he watched as the simple minded nature of the careless humans, developed into complexity. Quickly he too fell in love with their unbounded resilience and unmeasured creativity. 

#### Entry #4: 
${NAME} came to the archives this morning, beckoning me to come home. He looked as if he had been crying. I've had restless nights and fever ridden dreams, I've even begun to fear my plague may never leave me. 

But ${NAME} said if I were to be sick it was best I was sick at home. That if he caught my sickness then at least we would be together.

So today I write from home having eaten a soup ${NAME} made for me. The same one I used to make him when he was sick. 

#### Prison of the Gods #3:
Legends say he even fell in love with a human. Though not much else is known a child is rumored to have been a product of their love. 

#### Offering #2: 
I must caution you, fragile mortal, for my father senses an unsettling disturbance within the tower. He is keenly aware of your clashes with the gods and your adeptness in harnessing their powers to your advantage.

View it as a mercy that he opts to unleash more monsters upon your path rather than confronting you directly, sparing you from his wrath.

Heed these warnings.

#### Entry #5:
Perhaps ${NAME} was right. All I seemed to need was the comfort of being home with my son, for I seem to have recovered whatever calamity that had seemingly befallen me. For the first time in months I traveled into the marketplace. 

 ${NAME} and I even bickered about the gods. They disliked that I had suggested the lack of a impressive produce at the market was because the gods of the harvest were locked away in Babel. 

It wouldn't kill him to have a little imagination now and then.

#### Entry #6:
My ailment has returned this time stronger than it was before. Now a rash trickles across my pailed skin. Over the past week, ${NAME} has made me take different herbal teas and remedies to try. All of which have left me weaker than before. The village doctor, who I've known my entire life, refuses to see me. Perhaps he's frightened I'm contagious. Or perhaps he sees me as a bad omen.

#### Prison of the Gods #4:
Angry and resentful towards the ruling gods, the minor diety decided only he could make a difference. If he ruled over all, the humans would be rid of the chaos and pain. So he decided to use the humans desire to be rid of the gods as a way to obtain his crown. 

#### Entry #7: 
I am confronted by the relentless march of time and the frailty of mortal existence. As I lie in bed, I find my thoughts drifting towards realms both real and lost in myth. Is there purpose to be found in this crucible of affliction, or am I but a pawn in the capricious machinations of fate? Who's heavy hand is dictating that I succumb to this illness. Leaving my son alone in the world.

#### Prison of the Gods #5: 
The era of gods and monsters came to an end. Proud of what he had been able to do for the humans, the minor god sat upon the tower smiling at the humans, ready for the chaos to come to an end. 

#### Entry #8:
As the stories go, out of the pain, every 100 years the minor diety, would curse a human to die a slow death by sickness. 

I mentioned this to ${NAME} today, halfheartedly suggesting this was the source of my ailment. He was not happy. He has yet to speak to me sense my mentioning of it.

#### Entry #9:

i fear i might die.

#### Prison of the Gods #6:
But it was to late, the chaos had been sewn to deeply into the ways of humans. 

#### Offering #3:
I am pleased to see that you have wielded that sword with purpose. It was a gift from my father during the humans' conflict with the gods, bestowed for its unique ability to cleave through divine flesh. I once employed it to ensnare some of my own kin, blinded by my belief in my father's righteousness. Now, however, I see the folly of my trust. The sword now belongs to you. May you harness its power to bring about the downfall of my father.

Yet, amidst your valor, remember that peril still surrounds you.

#### Entry #10: 
When you were young I would tell you tales about the gods and monsters that roamed the world before the time of humans. When my mother used to tell me these stories I would dream go to bed dreaming about the betrayal of the evil king and the prison of the gods.

I realize now when I told you these stories growing up, you went to bed questioning whether or not I believed in the stories I told. 

I admire your skeptic mind, its one of your strengths. 

When I'm gone I hope you know how proud of you I truly am. 
														~ Your loving mother.
